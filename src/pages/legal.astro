      <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Disclaimer</h2>



      <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Liability for Content</h3>



      <p>The content of our website was created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these websites in accordance with Section 7 (1) of the German Data Protection Act (DDG). However, according to Sections 8 to 10 of the DDG, we as a service provider are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge about a specific violation of law. If we become aware of any such violations, we will remove such content immediately.</p>



      <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Liability for Links</h3>



      <p>Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. If we become aware of any legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.</p>
